Mention audio processing to most iOS developers, and they’ll give you a look of fear and trepidation. 
That’s because, prior to iOS 8, it meant diving into the depths of the low-level Core Audio framework — a trip only a few brave souls dared to make. Thankfully, that all changed in 2014 with the release of iOS 8 and AVAudioEngine. This AVAudioEngine tutorial will show you how to use Apple’s new, higher level audio toolkit to make audio processing apps without needing to dive into Core Audio.

That’s right! No longer do you need to search through obscure pointer-based C/C++ structs and memory buffers to gather your raw audio data.
